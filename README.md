Create folder named ```original_images``` to store a subset of images from the COCO 2014 dataset that need to be watermarkd, this is required for ZoDiac, DwtDctSVD and Stable Signature. 
Alternatively, other image-caption pairs can be using but replacing the ```captions_train2014_new_format.json``` file from the subfolders and using a another json file for your data with similar format.
