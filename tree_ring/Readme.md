Run the file ``` tree_ring_samples_generation.py``` after adjusting the paths, to watermark the images, these will be stored in the folder named ``` tr_sample_RING ```. 

Run the file ``` other_attacks_tree_ring.py``` after adjusting the paths, to test the watermark images on traditional attacks.

Run the file ``` tree_ring_paraphrasing.py``` after adjusting the paths, to test the watermark images after paraphrasing.
